## Examples - [my fancy option]

<!-- [full text section] -->
An example shall focus on a specific functionality, config option or at
least define the scope within the first lines.

The following steps are to be done to add a new example:

* choose a short-title to identify this example, e.g., `my-fancy-option`
* copy `docs/_example-cfg-template.md` to `docs/example-cfg-my-fancy-option.md`
* choose the title similar, but not necessary equal to the short-title. (human readable)
* add some descriptive introduction, motivation, details, references into the "full text section"
* add a configuration to the "listing section", which is fully usable within lovelace using copy&paste
* add an example image, best-case: showing the configuration within the listing
* add the example and a link to it to the table of contents in `/README.md`
