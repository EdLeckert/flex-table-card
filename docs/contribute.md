## How to Contribute

Contributions are highly welcome for `flex-table-card`!

Please consider the following questions before starting to work on actual 
contributions to avoid unnecessary efforts:

* does the contribution fit into the scope of this project 
  (in doubt open an issue and ask)?
* can the feature/bug be realized without violation of (backward) compatibility 
  and/or drawbacks for other features?
* is there already a similar idea/feature/bug reported as an issues?

Overall, don't forget this is not an human-safety relevant compontent. No people
will be harmed if things go wrong or some bug is introduced. :nerdface:

### How to write an issue

* Be sure to use the latest commit on the *master* branch
* Describe your issue shortly "What behavior is expected" and 
  "What behavior is observed"
* Be sure to include an example configuration and best case an image

### How to send a Pull Request

* A Pull Request should be the solution for an issue and the commit message should
  reflect this with a reference: "fixed #123 - what has been done"
* Don't worry too much about squashing, perfect commit messages and other
  formalisms (see the *human-safety* remark)
* Pull Requests do a perfect job as a start for the *right* solution
* If the Pull Request is somehow affecting the configuration, be sure to update
  the relevant documentation and/or create a new example based on the 
	[template](https://github.com/custom-cards/flex-table-card/blob/master/docs/_example-cfg-template.md)
